# Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze trends in state university admissions across the USA using data transformation and advanced visualizations, and to identify cost leakages in shipping through top-down and bottom-up analysis. The project aims to deliver insights that aid in educational planning and operational cost optimization.
